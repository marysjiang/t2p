# Tale of Two Partners
[Demo](https://marysjiang.github.io/t2p/)

## Overview
Tale of Two Partners is a tool that allows authors to explore variants in stories and generate dramatic contrast in parameterized, five-act storylines based off of their choices. This project is based on Janet Murray’s abstraction framework for creating variation in interactive narratives, proposed in [“A Tale of Two Boyfriends: A Literary Abstraction Strategy for Creating Meaningful Character Variation."](http://penlab.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/T2B_Essay.pdf) The project departs from previous iterations examining [heterosexual](https://rickyyiew.github.io/T2B/index.html) and lesbian love triangles, instead focusing on gender neutral love triangles between a protagonist (GWEN), the Partner of Obligation (POG), and the Partner of Desire (POD). 

This project was completed with the guidance of Dr. Janet Murray and the Digital Integrative Liberal Arts Center.
